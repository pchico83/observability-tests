* Configure a sut running the docker image generated by `/bug/Dockerfile` on port 8080 and setting the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY` (and optionally `AWS_REGION`).

* Call the sut api server on path `/create` to start a docker host on AWS.

* `/create` prints the host ip, which is received by the tjob using EMS.

* Check that the server is accessible calling the endpoint `/status`.

* Call the sut api server on path `/restart` to start a docker host on AWS.

* `/restart` prints the host ip, which is received by the tjob using EMS.

* Call `/restart` until the host ip is different than the one returned by `/create` (max 5 iterations).

* Check that the server is accessible calling the endpoint `/status`. It should fail.

For the fixed version, do the same for the image generated by `/fixed/Dockerfile` and the test should be fine.
